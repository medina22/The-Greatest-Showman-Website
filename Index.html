<p> The Greatest Showman is an original musical that celebrates the birth of show business & tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation. </p>
<div> Anything is possible in this show! There is a diverse character seperation and many stereotypes are broken in this show. There is no female objectification for the most part and the portrayal of women as weak is not displayed in this movie which makes up a trustworthy enviornment in the film. </div>
<br>
<br>
<span> This is beneficial for the audience whom watches the movie because they see the diverse characters. There is never a perfect person and everybody understands that by the end of the movie. "There is no I in team!" :) </span>
<br>
<br>
<th> The Greatest Showman is becoming to be my favorite movie because it is so inspirational and diffrent from the movies we are adapted to watching. </th>
<tr>It is amazing when you look at it in depth and comprehend every characters background. Everybody in this film had a diffrent story and everybody believed in themselves at the end. People were brave and were a part of a circus. If life is tough, people never stop and look back, they look forward and never give up! </tr>
<br>
<br>
<div> The movie caught my attention because Zac Efron and Zendaya were a part of it. They are some of my favorite actors because they are both diffrent, but similar depending in the situation. </div>
